## Target Audience

This course is specifically designed for first-year Master's students in the Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies (ICST) program at 8 Mai 1945 University of Guelma. The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of network and server administration, with a focus on both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Follow the Project: To stay updated with new changes and announcements, click the "Follow" button on this repository. This will notify you of any updates or new content added to the course material.

2. Create a Private Repository: Each group of students is required to create a **private repository** on GitHub for their lab solutions. Add me as a collaborator to your repository so I can review your work. To add a collaborator, go to your repository settings → Collaborators → Add collaborator.

3. Submit Your Lab Solutions: Upload your lab solutions to the private repository you created in step 2. Ensure that your files are well-organized and named appropriately for better visibility and convenience. For example:
   - Use folder names like `Lab1_IPv4_Configuration`, `Lab2_DHCP_Setup`, etc.
   - Use descriptive file names such as `IPv4_Configuration_Solution.txt` or `DHCP_Setup_Script.sh`.

4. Use Detailed Commit Messages: When committing your work, use clear and descriptive commit messages to explain the changes you made. For example:
   - "Added IPv4 configuration script for Lab 1"
   - "Fixed DHCP server setup issue in Lab 2"
   - "Completed VLAN implementation for Lab 4"

   This will help in tracking your progress and understanding the changes made during the course.
